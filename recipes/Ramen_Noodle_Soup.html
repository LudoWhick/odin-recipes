    <li>3 clove cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2/3 cups water</li> 
</ul>
<h3>For the noodle dish:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups water</li>
    <li>1 cup sliced red bell peppers</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sliced green onions, plus more to garnish the top</li>
    <li>3 cups sliced bok choy</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch, optional</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons water to mix with cornstarch</li>
    <li>8 ounces bucatini (or any other noodle or pasta)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Combine red miso paste, maple syrup, rice vinegar, soy sauce, garlic powder, black pepper, kosher salt, and sriracha in a mixing bowl and whisk until smooth.</li>
    <li>Add beef to the bowl and coat thoroughly on both sides, poking beef all over with a fork to allow the marinade to soak into the meat.</li>
    <li>Add onions and minced garlic to a braising pan, and distribute evenly. Top with beef, and all the sauce mixture. Spread sauce over top of beef, and add 2/3 cup water around the meat.</li>
    <li>Transfer pan to the preheated oven and roast for 1 hour. Remove from oven, flip beef over, and spoon pan drippings over the top. Return to the oven and roast for 1 hour more. Cover pan and continue roasting for 1 more hour.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and let cool. Spoon the caramelized onions over the meat. Cover and refrigerate overnight (NOTE: meat can be cut up and the recipe finished as shown without the overnight refrigeration step).</li>
    <li>The next day, cut cold beef into 1/2 inch pieces, and return to the pan. Add 3 cups of water, place over high heat, and bring to a simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender, about 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir bell peppers, green onions, and bok choy into the pan. Raise heat to medium, and cook until vegetables are as tender as desired, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bucatini in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 12 minutes.</li>
    <li>Mix cornstarch and 2 teaspoons of water in a small bowl. Stir into the sauce (only if you like a thicker sauce) and cook for about 1 minutes, while stirring. Transfer cooked noodles to the pan using tongs and toss to combine.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately with cilantro and green onions if desired.</li>
